# Task 06: AI Interview  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of **Research Task 06**, focusing on the creation of an **AI-generated street interview** using publicly available tools. The goal was to simulate a realistic interview between a coach and an interviewer, based on dataset-driven insights, while relying only on **free or trial-access tools**.  

The experiment highlights how **AI video and audio generation tools** can be combined to create professional-quality interviews, even with limited resources.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore free or trial AI tools for audio and video interview generation.  
- Document successful and failed attempts during the experimentation phase.  
- Produce a final **AI-generated interview video** showcasing insights from the dataset.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Workflow  

### Tools Used  
- **HeyGen** – AI video generation with avatars and lip-sync.  
- **Descript** – Audio/video editing, trimming, and final polishing.  

### Tools Explored (but not used in final workflow)  
- **ChatGPT** – Informational guidance, not for audio/video.  
- **Narakeet, VoiceMaker** – TTS, limited by free tiers.  
- **CapCut / Clideo** – Video & audio merging, tested but less efficient.  
- **OpenAI TTS Playground** – Free but limited for long interviews.  

---

## 🔎 Final Workflow  
1. **AI Video Creation:** Script uploaded into **HeyGen** to generate avatar-based interview clips.  
2. **Editing & Merging:** Video clips imported into **Descript** for trimming, audio balance, and final export.  
3. **Final Output:** A continuous AI-generated street interview video.

## 📊 Experiments Log  
A detailed log of all trials (successes and failures) is available in the `Trials_Log.md` file.  

- **Successes:** HeyGen (video generation), Descript (final editing).  
- **Failures:** Free TTS tools (Narakeet, VoiceMaker), OpenAI TTS (usage limits), ChatGPT (no direct audio/video).  

---

## ✅ Final Deliverable  
The final output is a **polished AI-generated interview video**, created by combining HeyGen avatars with Descript editing.  

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned  
- Free AI tools often have strict limitations (usage caps, download restrictions).  
- Combining multiple tools (instead of relying on one) creates the most effective workflow.  
- Documenting failures is as important as documenting successes, since it informs future research.
