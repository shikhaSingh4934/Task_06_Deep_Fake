README – Task 06: AI Street Interview
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of Research Task 06, focusing on the creation of an AI-generated street interview using publicly available tools. The goal was to simulate a realistic interview between a coach and an interviewer, based on dataset-driven insights, while relying only on free or trial-access tools.

The experiment highlights how AI video and audio generation tools can be combined to create professional-quality interviews, even with limited resources.

🎯 Objectives

Explore free or trial AI tools for audio and video interview generation.

Document successful and failed attempts during the experimentation phase.

Produce a final AI-generated interview video showcasing insights from the dataset.

🛠️ Tools & Workflow
Tools Used

HeyGen – AI video generation with avatars and lip-sync.

Descript – Audio/video editing, trimming, and final polishing.

Tools Explored (but not used in final workflow)

ChatGPT (informational guidance, not for audio/video)

Narakeet, VoiceMaker (TTS, limited by free tiers)

CapCut / Clideo (video & audio merging, tested but less efficient)

OpenAI TTS Playground (free but limited for long interviews)

🔎 Final Workflow

AI Video Creation: Script uploaded into HeyGen to generate avatar-based interview clips.

Editing & Merging: Video clips imported into Descript for trimming, audio balance, and final export.

Final Output: A continuous AI-generated street interview video.

📊 Experiments Log

A detailed log of all trials (successes and failures) is available in the Experiments_Log.md file.

Successes: HeyGen (video generation), Descript (final editing).

Failures: Free TTS tools (Narakeet, VoiceMaker), OpenAI TTS (usage limits), ChatGPT (no direct audio/video).

✅ Final Deliverable

The final output is a polished AI-generated interview video, created by combining HeyGen avatars with Descript editing.

📚 Lessons Learned

Free AI tools often have strict limitations (usage caps, download restrictions).

Combining multiple tools (instead of relying on one) creates the most effective workflow.

Documenting failures is as important as documenting successes, since it informs future research.
